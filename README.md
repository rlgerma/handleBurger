# Burger Buddy

A webapp for storing your most carnivorous desires that exist between a bun. 

Enter your meaty(or meat-less) goals in the form box. When the goal is met, come back and let Burger Buddy know you "DEVOURED IT" so your
efforts can be logged till the end of time (or whenever any of my free licenses expire).
